git status - used to display the state of the repository and staging area. It allows us to see the tracked, untracked files and changes. 

rm -rf ./Sample - removes the directoy titled Sample. The . symblizes the current directory and makes it so you don't have to write down the entire path. 

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" - when run this is what you get Warning: The Ruby Homebrew installer is now deprecated and has been rewritten in
Bash. Please migrate to the following command: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

  -e = tops the execution if a command during the execution has an error. 
  $(): execute the command
  curl: transfers data (URL) from server
  -fsSL: tells computer what to do if the command fails/tells it to do it silently/tells it to print error message/find new location of a url

  in the end I think this is code that no longer works to download Ruby.
