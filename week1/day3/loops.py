# loops always have conditions
# actions to do if the condition is true

# this is a while loop

#You can use the kkeyword break to stop a process or a loop
# while True:
#   print("This is True")
#   break

# choice = input("Wouuld you like to continue y/n ?")
# while choice ==  "y":

#   choice = input("Would you like to continue y/n")

# For loop is used on lists
# listOfSandwiches = ["PBJ", "Italian", "Club", "Tuna", "BLT"]

# for sandwich in listOfSandwiches:
